At the land of Kitakami, I, the player, met a trainer named Kieran. He appeared to be very timid, and not wanting to communicate with anyone.
    
    
        <br>
        <br>
        One day before going on an expedition to learn about the Loyal Three, for a school project, I got paired up with him for the request.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Hanging out with Kieran, I learn more about him. Kieran, though introverted, comes off to me as a gentle and friendly character. Eventually I, the player, later became friends with him.

<h1 class="Headline4">Kieran Has Changed</h1>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Fast forward to my arrival at Blueberry Academy in Unova, I later find out Kieran is not what he used to be.
            
            
            
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            All what I liked about him is lost and replaced with anger, vengeance and obsession to want to surpass me as a trainer. Back at Kitakami, he saw strength in me as a Pokémon trainer and couldn’t defeat me. This is what caused him to become this way and become jealous.
            
        </p> 

        <br>
        <br>
        <h1 class="Headline3">I Want to be Friends with Him Again the Way He Was</h1>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            I decide to take on the Elite Four’s challenge in the academy. I went with the intention to be victorious through progressing, so I’ll eventually get to Kieran, battle him and tell him to drop his current self, and to be who he was before and to be friends again.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Through my quest I build up care and purpose to help Kieran. Amarys before battling me:
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
    
            
            “For my part, Kieran is the younger brother of my dear friend, Carmine. Something in him has changed-he is not his usual self. I find this deeply concerning. if possible…I want to be the one to help me. That being the case, I cannot afford to lose.”
            <br>
            <br>
            She looks briefly at her watch, puts it away and then says: “...Our battle starts now.”
            <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
            After defeating her:
            <br>
            <br>
            “The strength of one’s Pokémon reflects the strength of one’s beliefs. Your desire to help Kieran is evidently greater than my own.”
            <br>
            <br>
            “No, you care plenty!” I say in response.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Drayton later on after beating the Elite Four:
            <br>
            <br>
            “So, Peter…you said you and Kieran are friends, right?”
            <br>
            <br>
            “Yeah!” I say.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Heh. No kidding.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Drayton turns back and says, “Here’s the Drayster take: I liked Kieran better when he had his hair down. He used to be this quiet little guy. Trembled like a leaf. Had all the spine of a Wimpod. He’d hide behind Carmine if you so much as breathed too loud. But I’ll tell you what… When it came to Pokémon battling, I never saw so much joy in anyone’s eyes as in his! But then, outta nowhere, he changed. Now he’s relentless-pushes himself, pushes everyone around him…”
            <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

            After defeating the members of the League Club, I get qualified to fight Kieran. I go to the academy’s battlecourt to register to battle him.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Our battle begins, and right off the bat, Kieran feels like he’s at a higher level than me, starting his match with Multiscale Dragonite and Drizzle Politoed.
            <br>
            <br>
            I don't know if I could beat him, but I also don’t know if I could not beat him. I try to hang on in the battle while the two of us lose Pokémon after Pokémon, having the same number of healthy Pokémon.
            <br>
            <br>
            The fierce battle goes on for quite some time, but in the end I prevail and become the winner. This crushes Kieran. And this defeat doesn’t appear to change him.

        <h1 class="Headline2">The Expedition in the Depths of Area Zero</h1>
        
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BvW1bBo.jpg" width="710px" height="450px" class="imageForArticle">
        
        <p class="articleAdjustments">       
            My journey later takes me back to Area Zero. Kieran, Carmine, Briar and I get assigned to investigate the crater to make sure no dangerous Pokémon inhabiting it will move pass through.
            <br>
            <br>
            The company and I eventually explore in the depths below Area Zero. Later on into the exploration I enter a room with the company inside it. Kieran sees a stone stuck to a crystal, which is containing the Legendary Pokémon, Terapagos. He runs towards it and tries to pull it out of the crystal, in hopes of capturing the Pokémon to become stronger than me.

            <br>
            <br>
            
            He manages to pull the stone out of its place. A head, tail and legs pop out of the stone. It is Terapagos.

            <br>
            <br>
            
            Shortly after Terapagos’ appearance, Kieran gets out a Master ball and throws it at the crystal turtle. And after a little waiting of finding out whether or not he successfully captures it, he successfully captures Terapagos.

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1 class="Headline2">Kieran Battles Me with Terapagos </h1>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Kieran challenges me to a battle with Terapagos. I accept and he says to me, “This time…I’ll definitely beat you, Peter!”
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            And so I battle his Terapagos and it takes on a different form to fight me. Though it turns out Terapagos is not strong and I manage to defeat it.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h1 class="Headline3">Terapagos’ Power Unleashed and Haywired. Problems Arise and Must be Stopped </h1>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/JtWSyum.jpg" width="710px" height="450px" class="imageForArticle">
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Briar, obsess with learning about Terapagos, looks into a book of hers to search how to strengthen it to its fullest potential, and tells Kieran to Teralstalize Terapagos. Kieran follows her message and teralstalizes the crystal disk turtle.
            <br>
            <br>
            This causes Terapagos to transform into an appearance matching the disk in Briar’s book, with strong winds unleashing out of it. The winds continue to blow out of it and because of this mighty transformation, Terapagos power becomes haywire and so strong it becomes dangerous to stay around.
            <br>
            <br>
            Kieran tries to send it back to its Poké Ball. Though the Poké Ball flings out of Kieran’s hands and breaks. Thus Carmine and I get out our Pokémon and try to stop Terapagos. This mess of Terapagos’s power overflowing makes Kieran regret having captured it.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        

           

            
            Later on into the battle things do not look good. Carmine’s five Pokémon are all worn out from battling wild Pokémon posing as obstacles on our exploration. With an additional one of her Pokémon also worn out from fighting Terapagos, so she can’t help me anymore. Apparently, most of the Pokémon in my party don’t match well against Terapagos. My Alcremie is the best Pokémon of my party to use against Terapagos, but even then it will only take two hits to get knocked out by the opposing threat possessing a great health-bar. It looks like a desperate situation, and battle I’ll lose.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="articleAdjustments">
            
            Kieran doesn’t team up to help me. He stands there thinking he can’t accomplish anything, knowing all the trials he has been through, leading to failures he has faced.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Eventually, all of the sudden, Kieran feels sorry for me, runs to my side and joins the battle to try to help me however he can. From then on the two of us battle Terapagos. And it looks like how the battle was designed by the game developers, it was intended in a way where, even for me, it would of been impossible to stop Terapagos alone.
            </p>
            
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZjhSjkk.jpg" width="710px" height="450px" class="imageForArticle">

            <br>
            <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Kieran finds the significantence in himself. He and I fight the opposing threat, and three of his Pokémon at times uses attacks to better help my Alcremie damage Terapagos’ health. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Eventually we defeat Terapagos. And Kieran sees all his attempts to want to be stronger were wrong. He feels shameful for having done so as well.
            </p>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1 class="Headline2">The Conclusion to the Story </h1>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Unlike the other characters of the Treasure Hunt - Arven, Nemona and Penny were in search in finding something they treasure in their journeys. Kieran, however, was also searching for a treasure - his goal of wanting to be stronger than me that is, but went about the wrong way seeking it. Alongside Kieran returning to his normal self - the kid I knew and enjoyed his company back at Kitakami, Kieran’s treasure, he finds out in the end, is just wanting to be friends with me, the player.
