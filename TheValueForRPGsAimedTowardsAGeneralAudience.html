        <footer class="footerForArticle">Disclaimer: This is a long article. But it can still be enjoyed if you only want to read certain topics below the headlines.
        <br>
        <br>
        This article is not meant to talk unfavorably about the gaming industry or anyone else. It’s also not designed to read like I’m demanding something. The words general in the title and article as well are being used to imply all ages beyond three, in case anyone’s unaware.
        <br>
        <br>
        This article is just me giving my thoughts and why it would be great if there were more video games of this kind to exist. I hope readers of this article enjoy reading my vision for a game like this and how it can approach people.

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
        
            By bringing up adventure games in this article, I’ll use those words to also refer to games with a story for players to progress and be a part of. But also ones that provide an actual human character to control to make players feel more like themselves interacting and exploring an imaginative fantasy world, and the overall feel like they’re in this gigantic, detailed and beautiful world they want to embrace.
    
    
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        This concept for a video game is phenomenal where you become a part of a story and interact with it (not talking about a moral-choice system). It feels like, again, you are interacting and exploring an imaginative fantasy world, and the overall feel like you’re in this gigantic, detailed and beautiful world. Along with controlling a character that’s supposed to be more like you via answering some questions, alongside plot moments that call for you to help or save others in whatever type of virtue.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    To me, it’s like the ultimate form of media. I wouldn’t say it’s the end all be all when it comes to telling a story. The stories that wouldn’t compliment a video game’s interactive identity, would be better in a different media form.
   <br>
   <br>
   The concept for such a game, there’s not a lot of them out there for a general audience - if you look at what franchises, around and not around, that fit that category. And today, I’m gonna write why it would be great if there were more of them in existence.

        <footer class="footerForArticle">70s poster for the original Star Wars. One of many movies belonging to a rich history of cinema that is loved by many.</footer>



        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            
            There's something to be said about the success of the original Star Wars Trilogy. Everyone loves the films. They're so universal. Think about how much the stories meant to kids who watched them growing up. Yet they’re still loved by those same people who are currently adults.
           <br>
           <br>
           
           
           And I wouldn’t be surprised if beyond the 1990s, more and more new generations of kids are being introduced to these films and finding the joy and meaning that those adults I mentioned found. 
           <br>
           <br>
           
           And I also wouldn’t be surprised if it created a sense of unity - think about how a son and father, or whatever pair or group of relatives, would connect to each other through this movie trilogy. Because these three movies are loved by everyone worldwide, you also get this sense that these movies represent how much of a vast global acclaim they have.
           <br>
           <br>
           I would love it if more adventure games took that amazing path. Also, everything I have said about the original Star Wars trilogy in this section, is what I would say about other movies as well.
           <br>
           <br>
           <br>
           Another reason to want to bring joy to people, is for people you have met in your life. If you have seen people in your life that have given you and others care and kindness, even if it’s a simple hello from a person you met on a walk, doesn’t it make you wanna love others more? Such a feeling can be a motivation to create video games for all ages - people worldwide.

        <h1 class="Headline2">Avoiding Controversies Will Go a Long Way</h1>
        
       
        
        <p class="articleAdjustments">       
            Not exactly Star Wars, but the Dick Van Dick Show is another form of entertainment that has been enjoyed by a lot of people. In the US as far as I know. It aimed at being a comedy for the family in the living room while avoiding world controversies at the time. And I personally think making entertainment that avoids heated opinion arguments is what we need more of right now. I mean, when entertainment is the definition of giving relaxation to people, why make it not relaxing?
            <br>
            <br>
            Stories also don’t always have to be aimed towards a problem in our world right now. You can write stories that are just designed to entertain, and level up people's virtue. (I didn’t know until later I made an RPG pun there.)
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Even if you don’t like certain things about certain people, you can’t deny they have the ability to change their ways and become better human beings. In a way, people like that are special. And knowing that, makes me believe even those people deserve happiness.
 
           
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h1 class="Headline3">Reaching More People and Showing How Great Video Games Are to Them - Reason B</h1>
       
        

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Not everyone plays video games. And I’m not gonna say to them why they should play them, or why their reasoning is nonsense. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            But even so, would it be amazing for these people to discover the medium and enjoy it? An adventure game is what I would recommend them if I were asked what they should play. And I think the right game to start off with in that genre, would be the best way to show to a non-gamer what makes video games amazing.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            And maybe there are people who would see the potential of what an RPG can bring, but wouldn’t wanna play them, because most RPGs’ teen content wouldn’t be their cup of tea. I’m sure there’s a lot of people out there actually that feel that way. Wouldn’t be a bad way for them to think when it comes to video games.

<h1 class="Headline2">Art Is Important</h1>
       
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jiERobj.jpeg" width="710px" height="450px" class="imageForArticle">
        <footer class="footerForArticle">Even though Kingdom Hearts III has a protagonist with a personality already defined not by the player, and that the game itself may have not been well recieved for its story, it has visual art that looks like the developers put their utmost stamina, passion and effort into.  </footer>
        

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Art is important. The more work you put into the overall world - the characters, scenery, story and gameplay - the more happiness you bring to people in their everyday lives. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Never underestimate how giving it your all into a project can affect people in their daily lives. If you give your all to a project, you make people see how special life is, and that it’s worth enduring daily struggles to experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Not sure how many people are like this, but it wouldn’t surprise me if every ounce of effort put into a game would be enough to get a certain number of people on board to play it who wouldn’t have been interested otherwise.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I think having human characters in a fantasy and story setting makes an overall world feel, again, gigantic, detailed and beautiful, and that players, if they’re controlling human characters, feel more like themselves interacting and exploring an imaginative fantasy world. Plus it would make communicating with fellow characters in a story feel more real and meaningful. Think about times talking to friends in real life, and how much they meant to you.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m not saying having monster characters in a video game would be a bad idea. I actually very much like to see what creative things creative designers can come up with when it comes to animals, or other kinds of creatures. I’m very much happy having franchises like Donkey Kong Country and Kirby continue to release new games. I would be really disappointed if those series became inactive. I think it would be awesome to have these franchises alongside the kind of franchises I love to see exist - that is the concept for the adventure games I’ve been writing about.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1 class="Headline2">Co-op</h1>
       
        
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            One way I think this concept of a game I’ve been writing about would shine, is if it were also designed to be a co-op video game. Though there can always be a single player option for anyone that wants to select so, whatever the reason. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Think about how many good fun times a father and child, or whatever pair or group of relatives, have had playing video games together. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Imagine you and someone dear to you exploring a beautiful world, experiencing an exciting story unfold around you two, getting involved in those moments, battling against towering-sized boss monsters, going through roller-coaster like joy action, and overall creating memories together as friends and heroes! 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Traveling with someone meaningful to you, would actually make you have stronger appreciation for your fellow sidekick in-game. Because of that, the moments you and your sidekick would go through, would make the video game a greater adventure. Perhaps your friend would be your favorite character in the story!
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Having a blast of a time with a friend can further remind you of the friendship with that person in real life you share. We all at least once and a while have to care for our friends, so that we always know the bond that defines us as friends.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Cooperative gameplay would be the best way to show the potential of an all-ages adventure. It would also be one great point from my article, along with other great points I brought up, I would like to see inspire people to create the games I would love to see exist.
