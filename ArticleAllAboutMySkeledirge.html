            Today I have an article that compiles everything that makes Skeledirge a fellow Pokémon of mine a fan favorite, cherished pocket monster, and loyal partner to me! To what degree would I say I like my Pokémon? Read my thoughts and history of my Pokémon to find out.

       <h1 class="Headline3">A Little Analysis On Skeledirge, And What I Like About It</h1>
       <img src="https://i.imgur.com/lXtneMD.png" width="710px" height="590px" class="imageForArticle">
       <footer class="footerForArticle">Offical artwork of Skeledirge. Picture from Pokémon.com.</footer> 
       
       
            
            <p class="articleAdjustments">Design wise, Skeledirge looks like a ferocious creature from the offical art of it.
            </p>
                
                
                
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
                Having the Pokémon’s design take inspiration from a crocodile was a good way to show that. But it manages to reveal itself as a gentle soul, not the crocodile you think it may be, from reading its Pokedex entry in Pokémon Violet, and viewing its happy animation, as seen on the cover picture for the article:
            </p>
                <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="forQuotes"><q>Skeledirge's gentle singing soothes the souls of all that hear it. It burns its enemies to a crisp with flames of over 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit.</q></p>
            
 
           <br>
           <br>
        </p>
       
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">The bird on its nose I don’t have much to say about it. Skeledirge and the bird could be based on the concept of a Nile crocodile and bird benefiting from each other in nature - known as Symbiosis. In real life, the bird eats the food the crocodile carries, and the bird gives the animal dental care. However, this is rarely seen happening between the two, and when it does happen in real life the crocodile doesn’t take a liking towards the concept. 
            
                
           <br>
           <br>
            
            
            But in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, there’s an animation where Skeledirge opens its mouth and the little phoenix, from the looks of it, is pecking at its teeth or between them. And it doesn’t look like the crocodile minds. It looks like the two of them are helping one another.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        
        We also see the partnership between the two again when they battle. When Skeledirge uses Touch Song against its opponent, the phoenix changes its shape to that of a microphone, and Skeledirge sings. Its singing launches the bird flying towards the opponent for an attack.
        <br>
        <br>
        That’s what I have to say about the little phoenix. But any friend of Skeledirge’s is a friend of mine!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I once made a video covering everything I like about Skeledirge!:

        <p class="articleAdjustments">       
            I don’t have a lot of memories of using Skeledirge in the Treasure Hunt actually. I have memories of using it for some of the Team Stars bosses’ Revavroom, and thus it being reliable for me. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I have a memory of Skeledirge looking like it was singing it out with Touch Song on Ryme’s almost fully led-up stage to entertain.
        <br>
        <br>
        I remember using Skeledirge to fight against Nemona’s Meowscarada. I terastallized it into a Fire Type to avoid Dark weakness from Meowscarada. Skeledige used a Fire Tera move to KO it with a powerful and sparkling looking blast.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Every once and a while I liked to take it out of its Poke Ball and interact with it in Pokémon Picnic.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        In other Pokémon games in the past, I’ve wished of using my starter Pokémon I liked in competitive battling after completing the main game. I never did do that though, because I always needed the Pokémon to have great IVs, certain Nature and/or the Pokémon itself wouldn’t be good enough for the format I wanted to use it in.
        <br>
        <br>
        But now in Pokémon games ever since Sword and Shield, it’s possible for me to max out Pokémon’s IVs, and have them battle like their stats are like that of specific Nature. Because of those options I was able to make Skeledirge powerful enough to use in Tera Raids.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        My Skeledige is a Pokémon that I’ve enjoyed using in Tera Raids, along with certain 7-Star Raids. It’s for its battling skills - I say as much in the video I posted above.
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p class="articleAdjustments">
        Here’s two recordings of me using Skeledirge in 7-Star Raids:

    <p class="articleAdjustments">
        The fact is, Skeledirge has been a reliable partner in my adventure in Paldea, along the memories I’ve shared of it in this article. All those past times together make Skeledirge a Pokémon to kind of cherish. It feels a little like an old friend to me.

        <h1 class="Headline3">What I Would Like to Do With Skeledirge Going Forward</h1>

       
        
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            
           
            
        I have an interest in posting let’s plays on the website. I would love to do a let’s play series on me trying to place far with my Skeledige on Ranked Battles or tournaments. I can display information and back story of my Skeledirge in the video while viewers can watch it battle.
           <br>
           <br>
           One thing though, with Regulation G, the one that’ll allow mascot legendaries to be used, replacing Regulation F in Ranked Battles on May 1st, I don’t know if Skeledirge would be good to use in the format. Whenever there’s a format that allows mascot legendaries to be used, a good number of Pokémon are unviable. These unviable Pokémon perform well in less powerful formats.
           <br>
           <br>
           <br>
           Skeledirge has also been a Pokémon I still use after completing the main game.
           <br>
           <br>
           <br>
        What I would like to do with my partner Pokémon going forward, is using it in more Tera Raids. Hopefully, again, online battles, and whatever opportunity opens up in the world of Pokémon!
