    Message from the writer: The new article I want to release, as well as new content, on the website is gonna have to get delayed. I don't when all the article and new content will drop on the site unfortunately. I'm hoping after I launch the new article and content on the Home Page, I'll be able to get back to writing and releasing storter articles and putting out videos and pictures weekly or a little over weekly.
    <br>
    <br>
    The reason I'm not gonna be launching anything, is because it's a big article this time around. Also because today I don't have the energy. I'm gonna have to go to bed earlier actually. That looks like the cause of my problem personally.
  <br>
  <br>
<br> 
I hope all of you reading this understand and can wait patiently until then. I would greatly appriecate it if you would. Maybe this is a good opportunity to catch up on things you missed. I'm sure you'll see the new article and content soon on the website. From yours truely - everyone take care and have a great rest of the day!

    </p>

    New article has been added to the Home Page. This is a long article. If you’re not interested reading the whole way through, you can choose to read only certain sections that trigger your curiosity and appreciate what the author has written.
    <br>
    <br>
    A link to the writer's social media account has been added near the bottom of the Home Page. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Message from the writer: I wasn't gonna make it at first, but I decided to work on an article giving my thoughts and theories on Z-A and release it on the Home Page. I highly recomend reading it! I think I have great insights and thoughts on this game if I do say so myself.
<br>
<br>
    Also, don't expect another new article until next Sunday. I'll be going back to my regular weekly schedule of releasing new content.
    <br>
    <br>
    And there may be new pictures and videos on the site next Sunday too! I know articles are the main focus of the site, but I'll try as best as possible to release other kinds of content on the front page to make it feel more like a magazine. Have a great rest of the day.

    New article to celebrate Pokémon's 28th anniversary.
    <br>
    <br>
    Subscribers of the website might or might not get sent an Email if they have signed up with a Gmail or Yahoo Email address. I'm in the process of fixing the problem for those accounts.
    <br>
    <br>
    Note added on 3:16 AM: Even though the website has been updated, there are things on it that are off because of that. You might need to wait to see it transform to a better state. The author will look into sometime not having that happen again in the future.
    <br>
    <br>
    Message from the writer: There may not be new pictures and videos on the Home Page this time, but I don't think there needs to be with the new article I made! New pictures can be found on the cover of the article, and another in it. Happy Pokémon Day, and I hope we all have a great rest of the day!
