        Its been said in the Pokémon games before that Pokémon aren't bad, and that they help the world side-by-side with people, who are more imperfect. The trainers and their Pokémon also learn from each other. Pokémon are a heaven sent to the people in their world.
    
    
        <br>
        <br>
        There are Pokemon, however, that have evil ambitions. Though these Pokémon have it in them to improve.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    With that said, in the Teal Mask there's an ancient story told about an ogre, who people feared, one day came raging from its home mountain and into their town. Three Pokémon then come into the scene and battle the ogre. The ogre then goes away. Thus, the three heroes sacrifice their lives in protecting the town. From then on, everyone starts to honor them, and call them the Loyal Three after saving the town from the evil ogre.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Kieran, however, a little boy living in Mossui Town located in Kitakami, doesn't go with the belief everyone else has about the ogre. He doesn't believe the Pokémon is evil, and thinks the monster is cool. His belief the ogre is not evil, I agreed with his opinion as well.

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Throughout my journey in Kitakami, I find out more and more about the lore of this Pokémon. One day, soon before the Festival of Masks begins, Kieran and I go to Oni Mountain at a place known to the town's people as the Dreaded Den, where the ogre is said to live. After making it at the location near the den, Kieran and I battle in hopes of the Pokémon hearing noise and appearing in the area.
            
            
            
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The battle ends, but the ogre does not show up. Kieran and I decide to go inside the den. We arrive at our destination. There the two of us get a sense of loneliness and sadness from the atmosphere.
            <br>
            <br>
            "Poor ogre… " he says.
            <br>
            <br>
            Like Kieran, I sympathize with the ogre being lonely and having no friends as well.

            Night falls, and the Festival of Masks begins. After taking part in a few of its activities, I spot a small particular creature wearing a teal mask from afar. The creature then moves away from my sight. I decide to try to follow it.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Shortly after deciding so, I find the little mask-wearing creature afar from me and standing on a concrete with steep stairs facing me, and other steep stairs in back of the creature leading to the wild.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Carmine, Kieran's sister, comes near where I am and spots the mask-wearing creature. She tells it to not go to the wild at night and says it's dangerous to do so. The creature back somersaults away from us and lands clumsy on another concrete, dropping its mask afterwards, but accidentally revealing its baby-like face.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            I pick up the mask and offer it back to the currently shy and disturbed Pokémon. But after the Pokémon thinks a little what to do, the Pokémon runs away.

        <h1 class="Headline2">The True Story of the Ogre and the Three Pokemon</h1>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AUau3mo.jpg" width="710px" height="450px" class="imageForArticle">
       
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            The next day, Carmine and I go to her grandfather to inform what the two of us saw last night. The old man tells us the Pokémon wearing the mask is called Ogerpon.
            <br>
            <br>
            He says to me the old story told about the Loyal Three and Ogerpon is false and tells me the real history of the Pokémon: One day a man and his Pokémon, Ogerpon, came to a village, but the people feared them, forcing the two to take refuge in a mountain.
            <br>
            <br>
            One man in the village, a mask maker, had pity on the man and Ogerpon. He crafted four masks for them to hide their appearances and fit in with the Festivals of Masks.
            <br>
            <br>
            </p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/gPFrqGO.jpg" width="710px" height="450px" class="imageForArticle">
           

            <p class="articleAdjustments">
            However, the fame of the masks people thought were beautiful, three Pokémon got wind of the items and decided to steal them out of greed. So the three managed to attack Ogerpon's partner while it was away and snagged three of the masks, but not the teal one.
            
            
            <br>
            <br>
            Ogerpon returned to its home in the mountain, found out about the conclusion of its partner and spotted the three Pokémon gloating over the masks. Ogerpon, furious, came running from the mountain to fight all three of them in the village.
            <br>
            <br>
            The villagers saw this scene and were frightened. Unaware of what was happening, they thought Ogerpon the villain and the three defending the village as heroes. Carmine's grandfather concludes the story saying Ogerpon ended up slaying them and returning to the mountain heartbroken.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            So it looks like as a fact Ogerpon wasn't bad. The story gave me more reason to sympathize with Ogerpon.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The story the people told of Ogerpon and the three Pokémon, before being told about Ogerpon from Kieran, made me unsure whether or not Ogerpon was a good Pokémon, even knowing the established lore of the Pokémon world. Like when someone’s life is not getting better in any way shape or form, that person thinks nothing will change. Even if they know for certain things someday will get better and that it's not good thinking doom and gloom will be their outcome.

            Later on in the story, out of nowhere, an earthquake occurs, and soon suddenly a shrine honoring the Loyal Three collipses. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After the noise goes away, the dust of collapstion fades away and reveals the Loyal Three in the flush. After a brief meeting with me and talking between themselves, they run away.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I head to the plaza where the festival took place and get informed that the three criminals took away the masks that once belonged to Ogerpon. The situation is not good: The thieves now have the masks to grant themselves power to use against Ogerpon. I then go and search for the three in Kitakami.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Through my pursuit and hanging out with Ogerpon in breaks, Ogerpon grows to like me. Eventually I stop the Pokémon and get back Ogerpon’s masks. I manage to stop the three from advenging Ogerpon. And soon afterwards Kieran manages to convince the people of the town Ogerpon was not bad all along.

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1 class="Headline2">All’s Well Ends Well for Ogerpon and I </h1>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6YQwcWL.jpg" width="710px" height="450px" class="imageForArticle">
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Ogerpon requests to battle me and to become one of my partner Pokémon and friends. The battle takes place near its den, and eventually I manage to defeat it, and catch it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Like I said, I hung out with Ogerpon, and along with being a not-evil character, Ogerpon is a peppy and gentle little baby. It delighted me seeing it animated like that. 
            <br>
            <br>
            It is no longer sad and lonely and can be itself I know and love - the personality I expressed it having. It’s a character that puts a smile on my face.
