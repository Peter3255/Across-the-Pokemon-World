            Today I’m writing everything charming about an underrated Pokémon introduced in Galar and putting a smile on my face. That being: Indeedee.
    
    
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Honestly, I used to not have much of an opinion on Indeedee. I remember one of my earliest opinions of the Pokémon, back when I was playing Pokémon Sword, was just: It’s a maid Pokémon.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I’m gonna compile all my thoughts on this Pokémon and let you decide in the end what you think Indeedee.

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Here’s a video showing Indeedee’s gestures in Pokémon Violet:
        </p>

        <iframe width="710px" height="450px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mbj3rWPV80I?si=CIQwZO84JwxGn_wR" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen class="videoForArticle"></iframe>
    </div>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
        The footage alone shows Indeedee is gentle and polite.

        <h1 class="Headline4">The Pokédex entries</h1>
        
       
        
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            There are two Pokédex entries of Indeedee I’m really fond of. Here is one of the entries about Indeedee in Pokémon Shield:
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
    
            
            “They diligently serve people and Pokémon so they can gather feelings of gratitude. The females are particularly good at babysitting.”
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            And Pokémon Violet:
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
    
            
            “In search of happy feelings—such as joy and gratitude—Indeedee bustles around, taking diligent care of people and other Pokémon.”
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

        <h1 class="Headline2">Visions I have of Indeedee</h1>
       
       
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Few Pokémon give images of themselves in my mind after learning about them. Don’t know what I mean? Indeedee is one of the Pokémon I feel that way towards.
            <br>
            <br>
            From what I have said so far about Indeedee in this article, I can envision a scene where a mom is busy at a kitchen near the sink looking frantic while the Pokémon, with an unfazed and gentle personality, is taking care of a crying baby holding the infant with its small hands.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another scene I have in my mind is where Indeedee is going about its day from one place after another in a household, stopping at points to carefully manage the house with its little hands. Like properly displaying flowers in a vessel, folding blankets, carrying them and putting them away in a cupboard, and so on.
            <br>
            <br>
            And another scene I can envision is Indeedee responding to a command saying “Iiiin Deeed!”

        <h1 class="Headline2">My Two Competitive Indeedees</h1>
        
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/LtGTISj.jpg" width="710px" height="450px" class="imageForArticle">
        <footer class="footerForArticle">My battle-ready Indeedee I refer to as Biscuit. Excuse myself for not showing Indeedee looking at the Rotom Phone. I would show a different picture, but I'm pressed for time.</footer> 
        
        <p class="articleAdjustments">       
            This is partly off-topic, but I also have actually had two female Indeedees I have used in competitive Pokémon. The second one I got because I wanted to use one that knew Trick Room. Due to a bug or something in Scarlet and Violet, female Indeedee can’t learn Trick Room via TR or the Mirror Herb method.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            They don’t have nicknames yet, but I like to refer to them as Biscuit and Vanilla Bean respectively! Like those yummy scones from Trader Joe’s.
            <br>
            <br>
            Update: Due to an error, Female Indeedee in 5-star Tera Raids have an identical moveset to their male counterpart, which erroneously includes the move Trick Room, a move it couldn't normally learn prior to v2.0.1 of Scarlet and Violet.
 <br>
 <br>
Prior to v2.0.1, Female Indeedee was unable to learn the move via TM and could only obtain the move via this error. - Source: Bulbapedia
