        Am I writing about something unrelated to the website? To that I will answer: Competing against trainers, in battles, that makes you experience amazing crashes of wit and thrill of overcoming hard challenges is part of what defines Pokémon: Getting to encounter every thing wonderful that makes the world of Pokémon one you'll always want to visit, seek and find one of the great happiness of life - what I have wrote on my website's about page:

    <br>
    <br>

    <p class="forQuotes"><q>The first two generations of Pokémon games, to me, though containing simple, old, visuals, give a feeling like I'm adventuring, wanting to know about these creatures from ancient myths and stories, becoming friends with them, taking on a role of a hero, and aiming to be a champion, as if of a sport. It's all an adventure a child would love to go on. Pokémon is like some kind of grand journey. It's like a child's fantasy.
        <br>
        This is, what Pokémon is to me.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other games would later be made in the franchise, and bring even more exciting experiences.</q>
    </p>

        <br>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            And that's how I feel about playing competitively in Pokémon. It's part of interacting with the world and immersing in it's themes. 
            <br>
            If I had my way, I would be forever traveling this world and always search and find what I love in Pokémon's universe.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Of course, when it comes to the Pokémon games, there's hardly anything to do when you finish everything in the games.

        <h1 class="Headline2">Turn-based Battle System</h1>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            One of the things I like about competitive Pokémon is the fact it's a turn-based battle system.
            <br>
            Because it's turn-based, I can take my time to think what I should do. 
            <br>
            <br>
            
            The game is not taking turns in immediate seconds, so it doesn't have an air of intimidation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When strategizing is the only thing you need to win, and you can take your time to think, there's strength within you in this game. 
            <br>
            You don't try to master several skills. And that encourages me to want to play better, and gives me a feeling like I can defeat anyone!
        </p>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            You choose a team of Pokémon, take good time to develop them to be battle-ready and be proud of your after efforts, and go on to compete with them by your side. 
            <br>
            <br>
            When it comes to knowing what Pokémon will be battling with you, it's like knowing what great friends you will be alongside: The strength or great support they provide, the trust you have in their abilities, the personalities the Pokémon have that will be your favorite characters, the charm, style or coolness they express through attacks or hanging out with you.
            <br>
            <br>
            And if you can have exciting battles with them, which you will be bound to have no matter your skill level, you will create a story that's memorable and have a group of allies to cherish.

        <h1 class="Headline2">The Definition of a Great Competitor</h1>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/eMJwIJf.jpg" width="710px" height="450px" class="imageForArticle">

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            To be a great player, doesn't have to be someone that's pro at the game, but a competitor that never aims for the top and always wanna learn and improve in the game. 
            <br>
            And in doing so you will enjoy the competition.
            <br> 
            <br>
            <br>

Whenever you can do well, doesn't need to be winning games, you will have a good time. 
         <br>
A feeling you wouldn't have had if you didn't try to improve.
      
        <br>
        <br>
        
            That's the spirit of the competition: What it means to be a player.
        
        <br>
        
            If I battled just because I wanted to be victorious or that I wanted to win prize money, I would become overwhelmed and play terribly.
       
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
            It really is about wanting to up your game and have fun to be what it means to be a player.

            Like I said: Competitive Pokémon complements one of the themes of Pokémon and is a way to interact with the world.
        </p>
        
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
        As long as there are new battles on the horizon of brand new days, and that are unique from the battles of the past, I want to keep competing and enjoying that part of the Pokémon sphere.
