        Message from the writer: I'm giving Discord a try for my website. Come join the Discord to talk about the content from this website, and other things gaming as well. You must DM me there and accept the rules I send you in order to become a member. Link to Discord here. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm the kind of person that likes to stop by and see if there's anything new on a page on the internet. So if you join, I hope we can enjoy our time together!
        <br>
        <br>
        Also, you can now subscribe to the website, so you can get notified via E-mail when there's new content on the Home Page. Well, actually, I need to test it out to see if it works.
        <br>
        <br>
        Have a great rest of the day.

        Message from the writer: I'm currently working on an article in tribute of Pokémon's anniversary this month. I don't know yet what date I'll release it. This article will take longer then my last article to publish. Because of this there won't be a new article this week. I hope you look forward to it. Have a great rest of the day.

        New article has been added to the Home Page.
       <br>

        New video of small length has been added to the Home Page.

       Message from the writer: I have a change of plans. I'm gonna be releasing only articles for now every Sunday. I have found I don't enough time to release a new article and other new content weekly. This doesn't mean you will never see videos and pictures on the site again. You may see new videos and pictures again. If so, I'll let you know if there are.
     <br>
     <br>
     I also wanna bring non-Pokémon content to the site in the future. This will be games other than Pokémon. Though I don't know at the moment how much focus to give the non-Pokémon content. No date revealed so far.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm gonna look into putting a subscribe button on this website and future articles. That way you will be notified via Email when I have new content on the website.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm gonna look into making a Discord server for my site. A place where people can talk about the content from Across the Pokémon World. Though if there's gonna be a Discord server for my site, I do want rules that state my it's for a G-rated audience. I'm the kind of guy that likes to see what's happening now and then, so here's hoping nothing nuts would go on in the Discord server. That's all I have to say here, and I hope you have a great rest of the day.

        New article has been added to the Home Page.

       <br>
       Message from the writer: OK, from here on out I'm gonna try to make shorter articles. If you wanna know why, check out my last message. 
     
      <br>
      <br>
    
    Also, the new article is the only new content I have for this week.
    
    <br>
    <br>
    
    I'm gonna hope creating short articles doesn't lower my Home Page's active view count. If you think my website would be more uninteresting with my current plans in place, please reach out via my business Email: peter-peyton@acrossthepokmonworld.net
    <br>
    <br>
    If you can write to me a concern for my website's future, and not just walk away after reading about my plans, I would greatly appreciate it. Even sending me an email of short length would be valid. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I hope you have a great rest of the day and enjoy what I have to offer you in the future.

       Message from the writer: I've been posting big articles lately. Making these articles, alongside making other new content, has almost somewhat taken away my time from other things I want to do. So from here on out, I'm gonna try making short articles after the upcoming week.
       <br>
       <br>
       I'm also gonna look into making other Pokémon videos beyond relating to gameplay clips or series of clips.

       Message from the writer: All I have for new content this week is the article. Nothing's guaranteed when it comes to posting other new content every week. I hope you understand and enjoy what I have to offer for the site in the future.
     
      <br>
      <br>
    Excuse the website's current state. I know there are a few things about it, like the not-well align text for the gallery, I don't like. But really, I don't have enough time these days to fix its faults. Nor do I want to hire someone right now to fix them. I hope you look pass its problems and enjoy Across the Pokémon World.
