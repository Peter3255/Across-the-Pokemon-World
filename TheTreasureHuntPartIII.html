        When you were a kid, did you ever dream of uncovering the mystery of the seven wonders of the world?
    <br>
    Ever dream of wanting to adventure the world endlessly - always meeting people, nature, and whatever else, and being joyous at everything around you?
    <br>
    Ever dream of becoming a hero, bursting through all problems and obstacles on your journey, and taking down the strongest menace before you - all in order to save the world?
    <br>
    Ever dream of living the moment of becoming the greatest competitor of all time in a big wide, exciting, led-up stadium?
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    So much in life that is to embrace and enjoy.
    <br>
    <br>
    Pokémon really does embody what life has that makes you want to walk out and experience the greatest dreams and creations that exist in the world.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    The latest entry of Pokémon, Pokémon Violet, offers a world to the player. A world containing many amazing and fantastical dreams to follow. 
    Whatever great path of life presented, and that you have a passion to follow and complete, starts with a dream, later a strive to obtain and finally the joy of reaching the goal come true and hold on to dearly. Something to treasure.

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Another story to experience in the game is the lore of the Paradox Pokemon. Arven and some magizens in the academy claim they are robotic Pokemon.
            <br>
            <br>
            We have had a few robotic Pokemon in the franchise already. Each of them having their own small lore.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            But because so little is known about them, having an experience where you learn about mechanical Pokemon raises my curiosity about the Paradox Pokemon. Because this is part of the universe we know hardly anything about.

            Later in the Path of Legends I spot a big, iron, mechanical elephant with digital eyes and containing a steel tread with red lights. This was one of the Titan Pokemon.
            <br>
            <br>
           This is where you get to see one of these Paradox Pokemon in the game. It overall was a big robot that looked like it was created by the genius of man.
            <br>
            <br>
            Professor Turo calls me to inform this creature comes from the future, and that it came from the off-limits, mysterious crater of Paldea.
            <br>
            <br>
            So it is from the future, huh? This again makes me curious about the Paradox Pokemon.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Come to think of it, with the future Pokemon being unlike most Pokemon, and powered by technology, it gets me thinking: Who are they? What is their backstory?

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h1 class="Headline2">I Read Entries About the Robotic Pokemon</h1>

        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AvqxERY.jpg" width="710px" height="450px" class="imageForArticle">
       
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
Later on in the Path of Legends, I read about an entry of a robotic Pokemon in Turo's abandoned lab:

        </p>
    </p> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="forQuotes">
    That being's name comes from the one given to an iron-handed entity in the mysterious Violet Book. It is said to have fists that move independent of its body and to be capable of throwing large, fast-moving vehicles.
    <br>
    <br>
    A leading theory holds that Iron Hands was once an athlete who became mortally wounded but was kept alive by being made into a cyborg. Why it so strongly resembles Hariyama, however, remains unanswered..
    
     </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="articleAdjustments">
        "Woah," thought me. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This Pokemon took on a new form from the scientific genius of man.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I later on get the opportunity to explore Area Zero.
The crater looked unlike anything that would be in real life. Some parts of it's scenery looked like nothing you would see in ordinary time, or something you would rarely come across.
<br>
<br>
The scenery contained grass, trees, a somewhat faded-looking rainbow, rays of light descending from the foggy sky. Sparkles flying in the air, huge towering cliffs, tall waterfalls cascading to large areas of low tides, and a mountain perimeter wall.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Along the way I come across future Pokemon. I find a robot resembling Delibird.
It moved around bended down. It would extend its head like a jack-in-the-box.
<br>
<br>
I had a fun vision once in my head of these Paradox Pokemon moving about and helping Santa Claus prepare for Christmas day delivery.
<br>
<br>
Here is what was written about Iron Bundle in a magazine:
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="forQuotes">
        The mysterious Violet Book makes reference to a being called Iron Bundle, which was said to look like Delibird and to possess a spherical apparatus from which it would fire huge blasts of ice to propel itself through snowy lands.
        <br>
        <br>
        Plenty of theories about it have been floated. A leading one suggests it is the product of a long-gone civilization-a notion supported by ancient writings that describe the design and usage of machines resembling Iron Bundle.
         </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Who would of thought an ancient drawing depicting Iron Bundle was found? An unexpected finding about the Pokemon to the player.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I battle Iron Thorns near the end of the game.
This Pokemon is said to be from three billion years into the future. Woah.
             <br>
             <br>
             It is seen as an improved Tyranitar, as it is calm and coolheaded, and avoids unnecessary fighting unlike Tyranitor from the present. It is also said to be highly intelligent.

        </p>


        <h1 class="Headline2">My Other Thoughts on Them</h1>
        
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/EZIbiJA.jpg" width="710px" height="450px" class="imageForArticle">
        
        <p class="articleAdjustments">       
            I later find out my traveling partner, Miraidon, is a cybernetic-made Cycliar from the future.
            <br>
            <br>
            Professor Turo managed to bring that Miraidon and another from the future through a time machine.
Were there more than two of these Pokemon? Did people from the future use these bikes to ride on in their every daily lives? I believe so. At least from what I know about both Miridon.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            There's also no mention of all Pokemon someday becoming robotic or cybernetic in the future.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of these stories of the future Pokemon look like they serve a purpose for the someday future. 
Iron Bundle looks like it would be one of Santa Claus' helpers in his factory. But it also looks like it would go about its day serving someone else in a different situation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Iron Thorns looks like it is designed to be intelligent and non-violent like.
            <br>
            <br>
            Iron Hands was theorized to have once been an athletic Pokemon. Since Iron Hands' design resembles Hariyami, and Harriyami's design looks like it specializes in sumo wrestling, it feels like to me Iron Hands in the future competes in a different kind of sumo wrestling, using its floating hands. 
            
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1 class="Headline4">What Will Be in the Future?</h1>
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Who knows how futuristic the world of Pokemon will look like someday?
            The stories about the Paradox Pokemon paint a picture what the future will look like someday.
            And that's a world I can see being sylishingly pleasing and exciting unlike anything I have seen move, work and look before in that universe.

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>


        <h1 class="Headline4">Closing Thoughts</h1>

All that I've enjoyed in this path was something I found traveling in the vast, open world of Paldea. These are one of the experiences I found adventuring in the Treasure Hunt. 
            <br>
It gives me a feeling of wanting to travel the world of Pokemon and seek and find myself in experiences that are all a matter of stories I love - are stories children of their amazing imaginations would want to journey and take part in. 
            <br>
            And if all the experiences would be put together into a story, would be one I would cherish, adore and look back on fondly - sentimentally someday.
