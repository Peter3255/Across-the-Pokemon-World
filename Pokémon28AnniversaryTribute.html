Note if the author's face looks more red than usual, overall looks more blury, it might be the display tone you set your computer on, or screen size you're viewing the picture. Also I didn't realize until later the dark quality picture I took of myself...</footer>

            I have been all over the Pokémon world. I have discovered ancient lore that, when compiled together and connecting its entire meaning, makes me think of the Pokémon world fondly, sentimentally, and a blessing.
    
    
        <br>
        <br>
        
        I have inspired a trainer to find hope and enthusiasm in helping the ones she cares so much for. I have made friends with Pokémon I like to hang around with, and grew an increased fondness to them through battles. So many Pokémon that make me smile, brighten my day, and am thankful they are my partners.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    When the world was at stake, like the legend of the heroes and the legendary Pokémon, I summoned the legendary Pokémon and fought alongside to take on the Pokémon threatening Galar. With the legendary Pokémon and Hop by my side, I took on the role of a hero at that battle against the colossal, noxious and invincible-looking dragon.
   <br>
   <br>
   I have seen nature that is vivid, and beautiful and looks like it is in harmony with the music of orchestral thrill, and dreams reached. I have seen the legendary Pokémon, the magnificent, rainbow bird that is sighted by a pure-hearted person, brings happiness, and is very rarely spotted flying in the sky.
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   And I have witnessed many more of the world. Even through all those adventures - I want to see more!

            The experiences I choose to adventure in the world of Pokémon, will be vastly different from others inhabiting the incredible and established universe.
           <br>
           <br>
           Out there there are countless uncharted stories to be forged. All containing potential for many different journeys to go on.

            The world makes me so happy that no matter how much I go through in my personal life, I will get reminded I can pass through those times, forget about it, and smile.
            <br>
            <br>
            And in the Pokémon world, even if there are fellow trainers that need my help to save the day, I like to think I can still bring that personality with me.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The stories inspire me to always keep my chin up and battle on to help fellow trainers and characters in the world. In those times, hanging in there, and prevailing is an exciting experience to immerse in.

        <p class="articleAdjustments">       
            Everything in the universe is amazing. I am grateful for it.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are still many adventures that have yet to unfold. And I want to travel the world endlessly and always feel the joy of the world in new ways!

            Alcremie, whom I caught in a limited-event outbreak and had a better chance of finding a Shiny Milcery in the event, for traveling with me in the Indigo Disk and fighting Terapagos when it was out of control, and didn't have any other good Pokémon from my party to use against it, and other good times.
            <br>
            <br>
            Scizor for getting me a hundred wins in the Battle Tower in Shinning Pearl, and other good times
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Miraidon using its signature move to dish-out big, supereffective hits on opposing Pokémon from Tera Raids, discovering its fascinating lore associated with the future Pokémon, and other good times.
            <br>
            <br>
            Skeledirge, my starter in Pokémon Violet, for singing to increasingly powerful heights, unleashing that power to help me defeat Pokémon in Tera Raids, and ignoring Tera Raid Pokémon's stat boosts. Being a gentle creature. Being an entertainer, inspired by Day of the Dead, reminding us fondly of our departed loved ones, and other good times. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Leaf Blade, my starter Venasaur from my very first Pokémon game - Pokémon Leaf Green, for relying on it back then in my playthrough of the game when I was 7, 10 or something years-old. For, fast forward, me using it again in Pokémon Sword competitive battles, as a strong Pokémon Gigantimaxed, hanging out with it in Picnic and using it a couple of battles in Pokémon Violet, and other good times.
            <br>
            <br>
            And other Pokémon I have no need to thank, because I have already praised them in this article!
