        What sets apart Sinnoh from the regions before it, is stumbling upon its lore and discovering the meaning of it's world you're in. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        After the player has received the Pokédex and gotten their first Pokémon of the region, they are ready to go on a new adventure.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        It isn't until reaching Eterna City and witnessing a certain statue, the world opens itself up to you and reveals mystery and enlightenment to its region.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        The statue is of a creature that doesn't look like it belongs to ordinary time, but of the ancient past. It is like a dragon that has the magnificence of an old temple.
        <br>
        <br>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
        There are words written on the statue, but the sentences are partly faded:

        From these writings, I can arrive at the assumption this world is a blessing, to be thankful for, from this Pokémon who was generous.

        Throughout the journey you hear the run-for-joy, exciting and eagerness-to-explore music that sets the sense of your quest along with doing what you would be doing in Pokémon games: Exploring, learning about Pokémon, and aiming to be the best Pokémon Trainer.
        <br>
        <br>
        The soundtracks I am referring to are none other than the music in routes 203, 204, 205, 207 and 208 themselves.

        Later in the adventure you come across a tall, gothic cathedral. 
        <br>
        Inside the temple, amidst the silence, you can see people sitting on benches, and a man looking at a stained glass depicting, what looks to be, the creation of the world.

        <q>Pokémon... People... It's only natural that we are all so very different.
        <br>
        Make sure that you never judge a Pokémon based on whether it's weak or strong.
        <br>
        You must always look for the good inside of them. That's what counts!</q>

        <br>
        <q>When people and Pokémon join hands, everyone's happy.

        It's what makes me look forward to a better tomorrow.

        But there are still moments of fondness for the past. Time can heal some sadness, though...</q>

        There are other stories of Pokémon passed that can be read in the game, but writing about them here would make this article too long.

            There's also the mysterious Unown. Curious looking creatures that resemble letters of the Latin alphabet.

        They mostly don't look like Pokémon, and look like they came from another universe.

        Were these weird Pokémon created to communicate messages to us? Because in a ruin where they can be found, there is a wall that depicts writing resembling the Unown and revealing another truth about the world:
