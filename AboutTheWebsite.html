        <p class="articleAdjustments">The first two generations of Pokémon games, to me, though containing simple, old, visuals, give a feeling like I'm adventuring, wanting to know about these creatures from ancient myths and stories, becoming friends with them, taking on a role of a hero, and aiming to be a champion, as if of a sport. It's all an adventure a child would love to go on. Pokémon is like some kind of grand journey. It's like a child's fantasy.
            <br>
            This is, what Pokémon is to me.
            <br>
            <br>
            Other games would later be made in the franchise, and bring even more exciting experiences. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            My goal for this site is to seek and discover the magic, wonder, stories and dreams of this amazing world, and tell its many stories and experiences the players can take part and interact with.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            I also wanna bring non-Pokémon content to the site in the future. This will be games other than Pokémon.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            If what I have to offer on the site makes people happy, then that makes me glad if I have accomplished that. If I can inspire people to make their own adventure video games, like games I would love to show and cover on Across the Pokémon World such as Pokémon and non-monster-catching games, then I'll be immensely joyed!

            I'll aim as well to bring content other than articles to the Home Page. I can't always guarantee that'll be delivered each week, but if I can I'll be glad do so. I like the idea of making the website feel more like a magazine.
            -->

            <br>

            I hope you enjoy the content I have to offer now and in the future.

            Meaning of the website's title: Across The Pokémon World is a reference to the beginnings of Pokémon games - the ones that began with, "Welcome to the World of Pokémon."
