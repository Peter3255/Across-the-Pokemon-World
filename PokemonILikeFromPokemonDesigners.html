            Today I want to write about Pokémon I like from a few fellow Pokémon artists. A few or a couple of Pokémon that is.

<br>
<br>

If you’re a fan of this franchise and know the full list of Pokémon these designers have created, it gives you the impression the world of Pokémon really is a big world. It just goes to show you there’s so much variety of Pokémon to like in it.

<br>
<br>

The artists themselves are the ones responsible for creating Pokémon we come across and befriend with in the world of Pokémon. These are the Pokémon that make us smile at times on our road to whatever we want to accomplish as fellow Pokémon Trainers. Or make us happy in a different way.

       <p class="articleAdjustments">
        
        James Turner’s philosophy in designing Pokémon is thinking of characters people would wanna be friends with. As he has said before in a video interviewed by magazine and website Game Informer.

<br>
<br>

When you see him in real life, as far as I know, he's a simply quiet and pretty casual person. But when he's drawing, you can see him bring out his philosophy and different sides of his personality into his characters. And you can see that in his fun, whimsical and happy Pokémon designs.

        <p class="articleAdjustments">       
            Next Pokémon designer I want to talk about is Atsuko Nishida.

<br>
<br>

Like James Turner, it looks like she follows the same belief of designing Pokémon people would wanna be friends with, if in their world. She’s come up with a variety of Pokémon different from one another, and James Turner’s Pokémon. 

<br>
<br>


Add to that, Nishida is creative when it comes to designing creatures. They’re unlike any creatures created at the time. A pleasant-looking cartoony mouse with long ears and chubby red cheeks - Pikachu. 

<br>
<br>

A Pokémon, again, creatively designed as well, and designed to be a cute turtle, which you never would expect to see knowing the animal in real life - Squirtle.

<br>
<br>
<br>



Perhaps you like things associated with the beauty and calm of night. Umbreon is a Pokémon you would like.

<br>
<br>

Perhaps you are a fan of fantasy, and would like to have a galloping, majestic and fantasy-like horse as one of your Pokémon teammates. Rapidash is a Pokémon you would also like

            Next Pokémon designer I want to talk about is Yusuke Ohmura. This designer hasn’t designed as much Pokémon as the other designers I wrote about, but he’s still worth writing about.

            <br>
            <br>
            
            The Pokémon he has created are, again, creative, and carry different themes. There’s Xerneas who is a Pokémon that represents life, the opposite to Yveltal’s representation. Xerneas looks like a mysterious and mythical creature that would bless life around it as it walks in a forest. 
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            A deer was a perfect animal to take inspiration for its design. As well as having its antlers resemble tree branches, with the colored leaves on it.   Because those ideas give you an idea the Pokémon lives in nature and at times miraculously grows and glorifies it. 
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Personally, a Pokémon like this doesn’t need more of a story for us to like it more as a Legendary Pokémon. It already has lore if you’re just going by what I have said about it in the two last paragraphs.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Samurott, alongside Emboar and Serperior, who weren’t designed by 
            
            Ohmura, are said by Game Freak to represent noble emperors. You might think even though they originated in a region based after America, they don’t look like they’re inspired by anything from that country. I mean, the United States itself was a place where many different people from afar settled. So technically, it isn’t an idea out of nowhere that these three Pokémon look the way that they do.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            As a matter of fact, Junichi Masuda has said when he visited New York City, he felt like the whole world was there. I can understand the cultural inspiration of the Pokémon from that feeling of Masuda’s alone.
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            The idea of making the starters noble emperors, feels like to me, goes along with the good vs. evil theme of Pokémon Black and White’s story. 
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            The idea of Samurott taking inspiration from a samurai, gives you an idea of its personality. That being valiant and honorable.

        <h1 class="Headline4">Ken Sugimori</h1>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Rdc0Qkl.png" width="710px" height="590px" class="imageForArticle">
       
        
        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            
           
            
            Last Pokémon creator I want to write about is the one that has been in the franchise's history since the beginning. That being: Ken Sugimori. 

<br>
<br>

He's a Pokémon designer that has created so many Pokémon with different themes, that you can’t quite pinpoint how you would describe him as a Pokémon creator. There’s not one word that would fit all different faces he has as a Pokémon maker. He has come up with the likes of, to name some names, Nidoking, Slowbro, Arcanine, Pichu, Unown, Blaziken, Dialga and Palkia.

<br>
<br>
<br>

Nidoking is one of my favorites from his portfolio. It’s this Pokémon that has this design that expresses strength, is embodied with sturdy armor, and has spikes sticking out from behind itself. 

<br>
<br>

It looks like a Pokémon with different options of fighting. Like its large tail that looks like it would use it to turn around for a strong attack. It has great Sp. Atk power with Sheer Force, so it can use great Sp. Atk moves, not just Physical. Alongside the fact it can learn a variety of elemental moves in both stats. 

<br>
<br>

It looks like it would be able to give good punches with its claws folded. There’s a Pokedex entry in Pokémon Yellow that suggests Its horns are so hard, they can pierce a diamond. Imagine seeing its horn on its forehead drilling an actual diamond and seeing chips of the gem spark out.

<br>
<br>

Combine all of what I said about Nidoking, and you have a Pokémon that looks like it would be exciting to see fighting in a Pokémon battle if you were to use one.

<br>
<br>

This Pokémon also shows the fantastical side of the Pokémon world. It shows amazing things Pokémon have the abilities to do. It makes one awe at the facts, and see what more there is about Pokémon that they wouldn’t have known was possible to exist.

<br>
<br>
<br>

Last Pokémon on Ken Sugimori’s roster I’ll talk about is Blaziken. This Pokémon was the first humanoid Pokémon in the francise. 

<br>
<br>

It can throw a large diverse range of thrilling melee attacks and jumps in battle. The Pokedex entries make it sound like anything can do it can do incredibly, like stating it can easily clear a 30-story building in one leap. It's like a supernatural human fighter in Pokémon form. It’s another Pokémon that would be exciting to see fighting in a Pokémon battle if you were to use one.

<br>
<br>

Again, this Pokémon also shows the fantastical side of the Pokémon world. It shows amazing things Pokémon have the abilities to do. It makes one awe at the facts, and see what more there is about Pokémon that they wouldn’t have known was possible otherwise. 

<br>
<br>

Since Torchic is its first evolution stage, you would think Torchic would eventually evolve into a traditional bird creature. That would be a potentially great idea if made to be a likable character. But its evolution ends up being something also great that you would never expect come into formation.

<br>
<br>

What makes Blaziken a bird, disregarding its appearance, I would say would be its capability to jump so high. It has its own means of soaring.
