    <br>
    Ever dream of becoming a hero, bursting through all problems and obstacles on your journey, and taking down the strongest menace before you - all in order to save the world?
    <br>
    Ever dream of living the moment of becoming the greatest competitor of all time in a big wide, exciting, led-up stadium?

    So much in life that is to embrace and enjoy.

<h1 class="Headline4">Nemona</h1>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            Throughout the game I come across a trainer, known as Nemona, who's competing in the same quest as me.
            <br>
            She's a fun character with an energetic and enthusiastic personality for Pokémon battling.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            In the last Treasure Hunt, Nemona became the champion, but didn't find a treasure of her own. So she's taking on the gym challenge again in an antempt to reach the joy she's been searching for.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            The fact she's become the champion long before I began my adventure in Paldea, and that I've had a few challenging battles aganst her here and there, further pushes me to want to defeat her and surpass her as a Pokemon Trainer.
And her wanting me to become stronger as one of her intentions for battling me is nice and generous of the character.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            I personally don't know if Nemona battled me with any Pokemon she used to become champion.
        </p>

        <h1 class="Headline3">Aiming to be One of the Best Competitors - the Takeaway</h1>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            There's strong foes to take on in the open world. And I would include them as trials to reach the top.
            <br>
            I like to think they are what I must win to surpass Nemona in battle.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            When it comes to competing aganist players in competitive Pokemon, climbing through and overcoming the hard challenges of the game you play, and becoming one of the best competitors in that game, after defeating oppoenets of power, is a tall great clift to reach, and find yourself amazed how far of a height you're on.
            <br>
            On that level, you can fight other oppoents in battles that form surprises, thrilling comebacks and powerful collisions.
            <br>
            It's also fun to see strength in one that can pull off the feat of reaching that level.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this path the battles still have powerful clashes, and are 40% like the great things experienced I listed above. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h1 class="Headline2">Conclusion of the Treasure Hunt Part I</h1>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">
            After I did eventually become champion of the Paldea region, Nemona gets wind of the news and rejoice that I am a stong champion like herself. 
            <br>
            
            She eagerly asks to challenge me to a champion VS. champion battle.
            <br>
I accept and choose the location of Mesagoza for us to battle.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            It is night, and a crowd eagerly gathers to watch Nemona and I battle in the square.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Eventually the match reaches its end, and I become the victor.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thus it looks like Nemona has found a rival she always finds a challenge to exceed as a trainer and train herself up for to defeat. This is all something for her to treasure.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            From here on out, as champions, I like to think Nemona and I are competitors who compete aganist each other both wanting to bring their strength to the battlefield, try to one-up each other, and, because of those goals, go for a blast of a time.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1 class="Headline4">Closing Thoughts</h1>
        
        <p class="articleAdjustments">       
All that I've enjoyed in this path was something I found traveling in the vast, open world of Paldea. These are one of the experiences I found adventuring in the Treasure Hunt. 
            <br>
It gives me a feeling of wanting to travel the world of Pokemon and seek and find myself in experiences that are all a matter of stories I love - are stories children of their amazing imaginations would want to journey and take part in. 
            <br>
            And if all the experiences would be put together into a story, would be one I would cherish, adore and look back on fondly - sentimentally someday.
