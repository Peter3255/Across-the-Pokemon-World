    New DKC TF Time Trial video has been added to the Home Page.
    <br>
    <br>
    New poll has been added to the Home Page.
  
<br>

<br>
Message from the writer: I can't promise anything from here on out, but I have decided going forward, I want to release new articles alongside videos using their writings. I really would like to reach more people, have them enjoy what I love to write about (the articles and/or videos), and talk to them about my content. Though I'm not a particular fan of my voice pronouncing certain words in recordings, I do want to try the best I can within a week or two week timeframe, whatever timeframe I end up choosing to release these videos. As well as articles.
<br>
<br>
Because of this idea I want to go along with there's going to be other media content, like images and quizzes, not be the focus of the site, and thus not have determined release dates. You could see new content of that media on the site one month, but not again until a while. Again it won't be the focus of the site because of the idea I want to aim for.
    <br>
    <br>
    I hope you all out there take care, and have a wonderful rest of your Sunday, or whatever day is in your time of the world!

  <p class="about">
  
  The link to the site's Patreon page has been replaced with a link to a PayPal page to support the site. Patreon links on other socials may be replaced with the link to the PayPal page if you are reading this currently. The change to use a different support me platform is because the writer wanted a fixed money donation option. Link to PayPal page can be found on the bottom of the site's Home Page. Link to the PayPal also <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=Y9YYJ6Z44CPD4">here</a>. Donating money to Across the Pokémon World will help replace the writer's in-bad-shape Switch too.
<br>
<br>
Added a link below the Paypal link called, "Why Support the Site". Link to the Why Support the Site also <a href="WhySupportAcrossThePokemonWorld.html">here</a>.

Message from the writer: I hope I didn't make regular visitors of the site waiting too long for new content on the site. Mostly inconveniences in my way is why I wasn't able to deliver right away. I hope you all do enjoy the media on the website currently. I'm not gonna be releasing an article the upcoming week, but I do want to release a Time Trial video, poll, quiz and, if I can, put out pictures and small videos on the Home Page.
<br>
<br>
Since Across the Pokémon World has a Patreon, you are now able to support it! But why donate to the site? As I wrote on its Patreon page (which I recommend zooming in on the image if you can't read it):

Message from the writer: Because I have not recieved the Debit Card I need to set up Patreon for the website, I've decided to not release new content today. Since I think it would be best to do so for me, who would like to be given donations to support the Across the Pokémon World, keep it going, and replace my in-bad-shape Switch so I can do more for the site (the system can't play physical games right now, and has a heating issue).  
    <br>
    <br>
    New content will be delivered soon after I can set up Patreon for the website. Expect to see a Time Trials Challenge video for Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, along with an article on the Home Page when I can release new content, and possibly a poll and screenshot quiz! I hope you understand the content delay for Across the Pokémon World. Have a wonderful rest of the day!

    Message from the writer: I'm gonna take a break with added new content on the Home Page. There are things I want to address on the site that a few people pointed out to me to be problem to them. I would say it will take me two weeks if anything to improve the site for those people, and anyone else it will benefit.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I hope you enjoy the new content on the Home Page. Have a wonderful rest of the day!
