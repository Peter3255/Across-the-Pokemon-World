            Plusle and Minun are a charming duo that like to hang out together and enjoy each other's company. 
    
        <br>
        <br>
        
        
        Up until Plusle and Minun, we didn't have these kinds of characters in Pokémon. I mean, I’m sure other than the Pokémon series there were little characters like them before in other established franchises.

            From these entries, you can tell they prefer to use their collected electricity to cheer on friends.

            <br>
            And it looks like the games they made their debut in also introduced Double Battles. Where they can team-up and take advantage of their Plus and Minus abilities to amplify their Sp. Attack power. It’s like the creator or creators of the games designed them to work together in battle.

            According to Bulbapedia, Plusle and Minun appear to be based after the concept of Electric charge. Here’s Electric Charge as explained on Wikipedia:
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p class="forQuotes"><q>Electric charge (symbol q, sometimes Q) is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. Electric charge can be positive or negative. Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other.</q></p>
