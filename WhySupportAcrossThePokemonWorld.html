            Across the Pokémon World is what I call a variety website, focused on Pokémon, and other games I like. The site has a diverse range of fun and exciting content. Content can be in the form of articles, videos, pictures, and now quizzes and polls! While I may be busy with other obligations in life, I aim to release all those forms of media or at least an article, video, quiz and poll every two weeks.

            <p class="articleAdjustments">Most of the articles on the site are themed around Pokémon, but I would like to write about games other than the series or gaming in general.

                The first two generations of Pokémon games, to me, though containing simple, old, visuals, give a feeling like I'm adventuring, wanting to know about these creatures from ancient myths and stories, becoming friends with them, taking on a role of a hero, and aiming to be a champion, as if of a sport. It's all an adventure a child would love to go on. Pokémon is like some kind of grand journey. It's like a child's fantasy.
                <br>
                <br>
                This is, what Pokémon is to me.
                <br>
                <br>
                Other games would later be made in the franchise, and bring even more exciting experiences.
                <br>
                <br>
                My goal for the articles is to seek and discover the magic, wonder, stories and dreams of this amazing world, and tell its many stories and experiences the player can take part and interact with. But I would like to write about other types of Pokémon articles as well.</p>

                I'm starting to do time trial challenge videos for the website. I want to release these videos every two weeks. And if possible, I would like to deliver a duo of gameplay clips alongside the challenge videos!</p>

        <h1 class="Headline2">Why Support the Website</h1>

        <p class="articleAdjustments">       
           
            I'm the kind of person that can't always use money beyond life necessaries. Donating your money via this Patreon will go towards a Nintendo Switch handheld I need to replace one I have that's in bad shape. To name a couple of problems with the system, this Switch of mines that's in bad shape overheats quicker than normal Nintendo Switches, and can't even play physical games. A system that's in better shape is what I need to be able to offer content of greater caliber on the website.
            <br>
           <br>
If the goal of replacing my Nintendo Switch is met, I would like donations gathered, beyond the goal, to go towards increasing the happiness the site can bring - the content provided by Across the Pokémon World. There's more I would love to do for the site, but can only do so much as of this time of writing. The donation would further go along with that desire of mine.
<br>
        <br>
If what I have to offer on the site makes people happy, then that makes me glad if I have accomplished that. If I can inspire people to make their own adventure video games, like games I would love to show and cover on Across the Pokémon World such as Pokémon and non-monster-catching games, then I'll be immensely joyed!
